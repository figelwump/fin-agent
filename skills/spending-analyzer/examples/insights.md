# Multi-Analyzer Insights Template

When the user asks for “insights”, run multiple analyzers and synthesize findings.

Recommended analyzers
1) subscription-detect (recurring charges)
2) unusual-spending (anomalies)
3) category-evolution (category usage changes)
4) spending-patterns (habits by day/week)

Then present a concise summary highlighting notable items and suggested actions.
