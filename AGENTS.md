# General

- Write comments in the code if it will help a future LLM understand details or nuance about how the code works.

# How to write implementation plans
- Read the specs carefully to understand the requirements and the overall architecture.
- Use markdown to write plans.
- Use checkboxes to track progress on todo items.
- Todo items should be specific and actionable. 
- Todo items should be organized into logical phases.
- Add notes on architecture, relevant files, technical decisions, choices made, etc as needed.
- The plan is meant for an LLM to work on it.
- Persist the plan to the plans/ directory

# How to work on plans

You may be given an implementation plan to work through. If so, here are guidelines on how to work with them:

- Pause after each phase so i can test/review. Give me a good summary of changes made, things i need to do manually, tradeoffs/choices you made, and anything else you think needs to be brought to my attention to review the changes well. 
- Update the checkboxes next to todo items in the plan as you complete them. also add notes on your changes to the plan as you go: relevant files, architecture or other technical decisions, choices made, etc -- these will be helpful for a future LLM to continue work if we get interrupted. ask any questions needed as we go.
