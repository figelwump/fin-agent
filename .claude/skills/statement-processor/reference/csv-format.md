# Enriched CSV Format

This reference describes the CSV schema produced after running `.claude/skills/statement-processor/postprocess.py` on an LLM extraction result.

## Required Columns

| Column | Type | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `date` | `YYYY-MM-DD` | Transaction posting date. Source extracted by LLM. | `2025-09-15` |
| `merchant` | string | Normalised merchant display name. LLM should emit concise, human friendly labels. | `Amazon` |
| `amount` | decimal (positive) | Debit amount with two decimal places. Credits/refunds should be omitted upstream. | `45.67` |
| `original_description` | string | Verbatim line item from the statement. | `AMZN Mktp US*7X51S5QT3` |
| `account_name` | string | Human readable account label from the statement header. | `Chase Prime Visa` |
| `institution` | string | Issuer/bank name that owns the account. | `Chase` |
| `account_type` | enum | One of `credit`, `checking`, `savings`. | `credit` |
| `category` | string | High level category chosen from taxonomy. | `Shopping` |
| `subcategory` | string | Specific subcategory from taxonomy. | `Online Retail` |
| `confidence` | float 0–1 | LLM confidence in the classification. Keep ≤0.7 when unsure. | `0.95` |
| `account_key` | string (hash) | Derived slug identifying the account. Generated by postprocess using `compute_account_key(account_name, institution, account_type)`. | `a462f0d4…` |
| `fingerprint` | string (hash) | Transaction dedupe hash derived from `date`, `merchant`, `amount`, and `account_key`. Generated via `compute_transaction_fingerprint`. | `713ec84c…` |

The LLM is responsible for the first ten columns. The post-processing helper appends `account_key` and `fingerprint` to enforce idempotent imports.

## Account Identification Guidance

- Preserve the account label, institution, and account type exactly as shown in the statement header (minus PII masked by `fin-scrub`).
- When multiple accounts share a statement, ensure each row reflects the correct account metadata so the downstream hash is unique.
- If the LLM cannot confidently determine the account, pause and ask the user before importing.

## Derived Fields

`account_key` and `fingerprint` are generated after the LLM step. Post-processing uses the shared helpers in `fin_cli.shared.models` to ensure parity with the existing `fin-enhance` workflow:

```python
from fin_cli.shared import models
account_key = models.compute_account_key(account_name, institution, account_type)
fingerprint = models.compute_transaction_fingerprint(
    txn_date,
    amount,
    merchant,
    account_id=None,
    account_key=account_key,
)
```

- `account_key` encodes the institution + account slug, ensuring dedupe continues to work even when database IDs differ across environments.
- `fingerprint` is a SHA-256 hexdigest; Pandas/SQLite store the full string even if only a prefix is displayed in logs.

## Sample Row

```csv
date,merchant,amount,original_description,account_name,institution,account_type,category,subcategory,confidence,account_key,fingerprint
2025-09-15,Amazon,45.67,"AMZN Mktp US*7X51S5QT3",Chase Prime Visa,Chase,credit,Shopping,Online Retail,0.95,a462f0d49b7e83ee3f65c5c61c1f21943c4d59e94c56b2b9a7d38cfad5fb8f61,713ec84c0a6ac0040b3d3fbefd9b7f324f4bca329dd9336e1f42d9fd2826ebd6
```

## Quality Checklist

- Verify amounts are positive and formatted with two decimals.
- Double check that transfers, payments to the same card, and refunds are excluded.
- Ensure low-confidence rows (`confidence < 0.7`) are reviewed before import or captured in the agent conversation.
- Run `fin-edit import-transactions` only on enriched CSVs containing both `account_key` and `fingerprint` columns; the command previews changes by default, so add `--apply` when you are satisfied. Use `--default-confidence` to fill blank confidence cells or `--no-create-categories` to abort when taxonomy entries are missing.
